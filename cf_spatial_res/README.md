üåçüçá These layers accompany the article **‚ÄúModelling the influence of climate change on characterization factors for copper terrestrial ecotoxicity"**, published in *Journal of Cleaner Production* (2023) by Ivan Viveros Santos, Annie Levasseur, C√©cile Bulle, Louise Desch√™nes, and Anne-Marie Boulay. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137601" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137601</a>


The names of the layers follow this pattern: `cf_spatial-aggregation_scenario.shp`

Where:
 - Spatial aggregation (`spatial-aggregation`) was performed at the level of the wine-growing regions (`wr`) and European regions as defined by the NUTS2 classification system (`nuts2`).
 - Scenarios: Are self-explanatory.
 

Columns of attribute tables:
 - Apart from **aw_cf**, the column names of the attribute tables are self-explanatory.
 - **aw_cf** stands for area-weighted average of characterization factors (CFs) for a given spatial resolution.
