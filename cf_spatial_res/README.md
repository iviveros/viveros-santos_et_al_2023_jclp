These layers accompany the revised manuscript “Modelling the influence of climate change on characterization factors for copper terrestrial ecotoxicity” by Ivan Viveros Santos, Annie Levasseur, Cécile Bulle, Louise Deschênes, and Anne-Marie Boulay, for consideration of publication in *Journal of Cleaner Production*.

The names of the layers follow this pattern: `cf_spatial-aggregation_scenario.shp`

Where:
 - Spatial aggregation (`spatial-aggregation`) was performed at the level of the wine-growing regions (`wr`) and European regions as defined by the NUTS2 classification system (`nuts2`).
 - Scenarios: Are self-explanatory.
 

Columns of attribute tables:
 - Apart from **aw_cf**, the column names of the attribute tables are self-explanatory.
 - **aw_cf** stands for area-weighted average of characterization factors (CFs) for a given spatial resolution.
