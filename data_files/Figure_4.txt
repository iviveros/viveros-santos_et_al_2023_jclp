Fig. 4 was built based on the layers (shapefiles) of CFs found in the folder cf_spatial_res 
following the link:
https://github.com/iviveros/viveros-santos_et_al_2023_jclp/tree/main/cf_spatial_res

The relative change (%) in area-weighted CFs compared to the baseline scenario for RCPs scenarios 
was computed according to:

rel_delta_cf = 100 *((cf_future- cf_base)/cf_base)

The variable for computing the relative change in CFs was aw_cf, which stands for area-weighted 
average of characterization factors (CFs) for a given wine-growing region.

With cf_future in:
cf_wr_rcp26
cf_wr_rcp45
cf_wr_rcp85

And cf_base:
cf_wr_baseline
