Fig. 3 was built based on the layers (shapefiles) of CFs found in the folder cf_spatial_res 
following the link:
https://github.com/iviveros/viveros-santos_et_al_2023_jclp/tree/main/cf_spatial_res

The shapefiles are:

cf_wr_baseline
cf_wr_rcp26
cf_wr_rcp45
cf_wr_rcp85

The mapped variable is aw_cf, which stands for area-weighted average of characterization 
factors (CFs) for a given wine-growing region.
